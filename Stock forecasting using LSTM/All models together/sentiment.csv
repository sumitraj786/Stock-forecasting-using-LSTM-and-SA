For instance, the retail part recently saw a slew of acquisitions in the fashion space. They have added Campa Cola and I thought they would be advertising it like crazy in the IPL. I have not seen that\. But there is that as well that is coming in from the retail front. On Jio, I think the acquisition numbers we are seeing Vodafone lose more and more in terms of subscribers. Jio will probably get more as a result of the IPL and due to some of the new plans that they are coming up with, what they are doing with 5G and the phones coming later this year, there is this potential move there. Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Executive Officer Programme Visit Indian School of Business ISB Chief Digital Officer Visit IIM Kozhikode IIMK Chief Product Officer Programme Visit There is the financial services demerger which unlocks roughly Rs 85,000 crore of value over the next four or five years into a subsidiary which all current shareholders of Reliance will get as part of their ownership. So that is another part, an unexpected part of that business. Apart from that, they have the oil and gas, refining and petchem business, which I think is relatively strong compared to any other competitor in India. So, there are fairly good cash flows. Their ROEs are nothing to write home about right now. I think whenever a demerger happens, it will trigger a re-rating in the stock price. But earnings this quarter should be very interesting. Hopefully there will be better earnings from their oil and gas business and much more from the retail and Jio business as well. All are adding up to where the current PE is now 22 or 23 times historical. I believe if they get their earnings right, it might fall below 20 as well.

In some of these categories, Reliance has done well in their own private label business in the modern trade, but in personal care, soaps, and a lot of the hair care etc. What happens with Reliance's foray into more regional FMCG brands? They are planning to partner with 10 million merchants over the next five years. The recent acquisition includes the likes of Lotus Chocolate, Sosyo Hajoori, partnership with Maliban is also coming in. Whose market share do they eatinto with this? We released a very detailed report on Reliance FMCG on Monday. One thing is, anything Reliance does, the other FMCG players and analysts will see very closely, very seriously, because Reliance has shown that they can disrupt a sector. Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business ISB Chief Technology Officer Visit IIM Kozhikode IIMK Chief Product Officer Programme Visit IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Marketing Officer Programme Visit Having said that, in FMCG, the disruption by a new player is very rare because due to brand loyalty, distribution, technological know-how and the data which now all large FMCG companies have, has become very difficult for newcomers to disrupt the industry. Also, we have seen that D2C start-ups in FMCG are having a very tough time. We have seen the listed FMCG companies acquire some of those and that again will help them in terms of market share. I will say that in most of the personal care and even in food, say biscuits and chocolates, it will be very tough for a new player to have a big dent in terms of market share. Reliance knows all this. So they will also pick and choose which battle to focus on. So commoditised FMCG, where Adani Wilmar has a good play, there the market share of the organised players is fairly limited and the opportunity size is very large. Being India's largest modern-day player and a very strong ecommerce grocery player also, Reliance already has a right to win in those kinds of FMCG which are a bit more commoditized.",2352.0

Edited excerpts from a chat. We saw Nifty and Nifty Bank throwing up contrasting pictures last week. Technically, how do you read this and what are the charts looking like for both indices this week? Nifty has been trading in an uptrend with formations of higher highs and higher lows. The index has also managed to sustain above its 21DEMA since April 2023. Nifty is trading in an ascending channel pattern and bouncing strongly whenever it approaches the channel support. Bank Nifty, on the other hand, has been in a battle between bulls and bears near 44150 levels which was the previous life high levels. The index is currently trading below its 21DEMA which is the reason behind its underperformance as compared to Nifty. While Nifty is expected to test 18900-18950 levels in the coming days, Bank Nifty is expected to gain momentum only after a close above 44300 levels",2551.800048828125
